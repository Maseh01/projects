# Road Accidents Analysis and Visualization
### Problem Statement
Road safety is a critical public health concern. Analyzing accident data is essential for understanding contributing factors, identifying high-risk areas, and developing effective safely interventions.
### Objective
This interactive Excel Dashboard provides an overview of road accidents focusing on casualty severity and contributing factors to support data-driven decision making for improving road safety.
### Data
The dataset included information on accident severity, location(longitude/latitude), time, vehicle type, road conditions, and other relevant factors.

### Methodology
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing- Used Excel functions and techniques to clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Data Exploration- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution patterns and relationships within the data. Used pivot tables, charts and statistical measures to identify key trends and anomalies.
- Data Visualization- Created interactive visualizations using Excelâ€™s charting capabilities to present the insights and findings in a clear and engaging manner.
- Dashboard Development- Designed and developed a comprehensive excel dashboard that includes various charts, graphs, and tables to visualize the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and provide insights into road accident patterns.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
### Fatal, Serious & Slight Casualties
Displays the total number of casualties categorized by severity, offering an immediate snapshot of road safety.

### Casualties by Car
Highlights the proportion of casualties specifically involving cars, indicating the significance of car-related accidents.

### Interactive Features:
__Filter Navigation__- Allow users to filter data by various parameters (Month, Year, Day of Week, Accident Severity (e.t.c) to focus on specific trends and analyze subsets of accidents.

## Data Visualization
__Monthly Trend Line Chart__- Shows the fluctuation of casualties over time, revealing potential seasonal patterns or long-term trends.
#### Casualties by Road Type
__Funnel Chart__- Visualizes the distribution of casualties across different road types e.g single carriageway, dual, roundabout, to identify high-risk road environments 
#### Casualties by Road Surface
__Box Plot__- Illustrates the distribution of casualties based on road surface conditions (dry, wet, snow/icy) to understand the impact of weather on accident severity.
#### Casualties by Light Condition & Weather
__Doughnut Chart__- Provide a clear visual representation of the proportion of casualties during different light conditions (day/night) and weather conditions.
## Impact and Potential Applications
- __Identifying High-Risk Areas and Periods__- The dashboard enables the identification of locations, times and conditions with higher accidents rates. This information can guide targeted safety interventions, such as increased police patrols or road infrastructure improvements.
- __Analyzing Contributing Factors__- By exploring relationships between casualty severity and factors like road type, surface conditions, and weather, the dashboard helps identify key contributions to road accidents, informing preventive measures and public safety campaigns.
- __Supporting Policy Decisions__- The dashboard provides data-driven insights for policy makers and traffic authorities to develop effective road safety strategies and allocate resources efficiently.
- __Raising Public Awareness__- The visualized data can be used to educate the public about road safety risks and promote responsible driving behaviors.
## Impact
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of excel in visualizing and analyzing complex data to provide meaningful insights.
## Excel Skills Demonstrated 
- __Data Cleaning & Preparation__- Importing, cleaning and structuring the road accidents dataset for analysis.
- __Data Analysis and Calculation__- Creating formulas and functions to calculate KPIs and summarize data for visualization.
- __Data Visualization__- Using excel charts to represent data visually and highlighting key insights
- __Dashboard Design and Interactivity__- Designing a user-friendly dashboard layout with filter controls for dynamic data exploration.
